In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a software design pattern that enables an algorithm’s behavior to be selected at runtime.

The strategy pattern:

defines a family of algorithms,

encapsulates each algorithm, and

makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.”


Comparing our design to the definition of strategy pattern encapsulated grooming and shedding behaviors are two families of algorithms. And these algorithms are interchangeable as evident in implementation.
