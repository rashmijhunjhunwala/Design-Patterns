The Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

One to many dependancy means there must be one subject and many observers.It is said to be a dependancy because the observers do not ask for the change in state of the subject , it is the subject which provides them with the data.
